- They are commonly used in menus, instructions, features, and content sections on websites.

## What Is an HTML List?

- An HTML list is a collection of items grouped together.  
- Each item in a list is written using the `<li>` (list item) tag.

- HTML provides **three main types of lists**:
    1. Unordered List
    2. Ordered List
    3. Description List

## 1. Unordered List (`<ul>`)

An unordered list displays items with **bullet points**.

### Example:
```html
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
```

### Explanation:
- `<ul>` defines an unordered list
- `<li>` represents each list item
- Items appear with bullet points by default
- Commonly used for navigation menus and feature lists

## 2. Ordered List (`<ol>`)

An ordered list displays items in a **numbered order**.

### Example:
```html
<ol>
  <li>Learn HTML</li>
  <li>Learn CSS</li>
  <li>Learn JavaScript</li>
</ol>
```

### Explanation:
- `<ol>` defines an ordered list
- Items are automatically numbered
- Useful for steps, instructions, and rankings

## 3. Description List (`<dl>`)

A description list is used to display terms with their definitions.

### Example:
```html
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>

  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
</dl>
```

### Explanation:
- `<dl>` defines the description list
- `<dt>` is the term name
- `<dd>` is the description of the term
- Commonly used for glossaries and FAQs
