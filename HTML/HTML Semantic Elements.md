# HTML Semantic Elements

- In this part, I am learning about **HTML Semantic Elements**.  
- Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer.

## What Are Semantic Elements?

Semantic HTML elements tell **what type of content** they contain.  
Unlike generic tags like `<div>` and `<span>`, semantic tags provide meaning.
